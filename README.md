# Mine-Sweeeper
Totally different from Mine Sweeper

This project was build using Eclipse 2020-06 and requires javafx to be installed. 
The following VM arguments must be added for compiling the project:

--module-path "C:\Users\<the-path-to-your-copy-of-javafx-sdk-15>"
--add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml

Congtrary to the description on the second line of this document, this application is exactly like Mine Sweeper. 
I designed this project to get some experience desiging UIs, particularly with JavaFX.
